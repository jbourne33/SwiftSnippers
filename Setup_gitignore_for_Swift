#Creating a .gitignore for Swift XCode projects

#First, open a Terminal window and enter the following command. You only need to do this step once, not for every project.
$ git config --global alias.ignore '!gi() { curl -L -s https://www.gitignore.io/api/$@ ;}; gi'

#Now, for any project using Git, do the following in a Terminal window:
cd <directory where your project is stored>
git ignore swift,macos >.gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"

#This downloads the most current .gitignore configuration for writing Swift code on macOS.

#Note that you added the .gitignore file to your repository for Git to track since the filtering it provides is also an important part of your project.
